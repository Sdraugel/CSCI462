# TSD (Test Stand Diagnostics)

This piece of software was designed to 
1. Track the first pass percentage of the Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) as they are tested.
2. Notify test engineers via email when the average percentage drops below a certain threshold.
3. Once a part has been tested and shown failure, the software will diagnose the problem by parsing the data from the test sensors and display the solution to the engineer.
